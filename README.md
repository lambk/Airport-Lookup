# Airport-Lookup
#### Kyle Lamb

## Personal site for viewing weather and general information for an airport.

Uses the CheckWX API to collect basic airport information (title, latlong, elevation, etc) for a given ICAO code
The current weather information for the station is fetched and presented in standard METAR format

- Airport data is cached for 30 days from first fetch
- Weather information is cached for 30 minutes

Includes user accounts for favouriting up to 5 airports for quick access from the main page

Suggestions are highly welcome
